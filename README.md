#Mini-drone_with_picow-esp32

I used the arduino IDE to write mpu6050 based flight control code for simple flight of a drone.

##ESP32 & Picow

The code adapts to hardware  including esp32 and Raspberry Pi Pico W, using wifi control.

(The Wifi distance of esp32 is enough, while the wifi distance of PicoW is only about two meters, it is recommended to use esp32)
